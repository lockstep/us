                Trustbooks is a specialized SaaS solution built specifically for law firms to manage their clients’ trust accounts. We collaborated with our client to simplify and optimize the user experience and workflow with an efficient, UX-driven design process. The application handles the complexity and ensures legal compliance across all 50 states with the ability to easily modify rules as new regulations are enacted.

              <p class="paragraph-primary">
                Only two things scare lawyers: Trust accounting and other lawyers. This exciting SaaS solution makes trust accounting dead simple, and ensures that lawyers stay compliant with their State Bar without hiring expensive specialists. TrustBooks has built-in controls to ensure firms stay on track while managing all of the necessary workflows, from printing checks to reconciling accounts. Think of QuickBooks without the headache.

              <p class="paragraph-primary">
                Our priorities during the Version 1 build were simplicity and security. Since accounting tools are intrinsically complex we followed a rigorous "front first" approach to test workflows before any backend functionality was added. And given the sensitive nature of the legal market we took extra precautions against malicious use. TrustBooks users can be confident that their data is being protected by best practice architecture and best-in-class infrastructure providers.
